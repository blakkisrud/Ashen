Ashen is a Python resource designed to extract and work with information from ICRP Publication 107, a comprehensive collection of physical properties of radionuclides. It provides simple access to radionuclide data for use in research, clinical applications, or educational purposes.

This was mostly made as a pet project in accociation with absorbed dose calculation for radionuclide therapy. The goal is to provide a simple interface to access the data in ICRP 107, and to make it easy to use in Python.

This is still under development and contributions are welcome, please make a pull request or open an issue if you have any suggestions or improvements.

## Features

- Access radionuclide physical properties from ICRP 107

- Easy-to-use Python functions

- Demonstration script to get started

- Planned support for:

    - Command-line interface (CLI)

    - Simple graphical user interface (GUI)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ashen.git
cd ashen
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

- A simple example script is provided in the demo.py file to demonstrate how to use the functions in Ashen.

Future versions will include:

-     A command-line tool for quick access to data.

-     A lightweight graphical interface for browsing radionuclide properties.
